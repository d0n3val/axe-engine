Axe coding goals
----------------

Axe (Axe is a X-rated Engine) is a freeware 3D game engine. This is the list of
coding goals:

- Mainly we code it to learn and get fun!

- Clarity and simplicity before ofuscated but very_optimized code.

- Completely open source, use it in free or comercial projects

- Target system software: MS Windows 2000+ with DirectX 9.0+

- Target system hardware: Pentium III+ and Geforce FX / ATI Radeon

- Try to not re-inventing the wheel, but in case we get fun coding this part!

- All project will use simple english (we are spanish, so spect some errors as you
  can see around ;)
  
- Eye-candy effects will be the last thing to do. First of all is a robust core
  code.

- The project will have three phases: In the first one, all base code will get
  writed, only unavoidable code. In the second phase we will point out a little
  game and implement the rest of the code we need to make run this game. The
  third is still to define, but will contain, mainly, visual effects.
  
- The engine will be based on an editor. This editor must be enough to implement
  all that is needed to create a complete game.
  
- It have to be possible to save, load, pause the game. It's also important to
  be able to reproduce an exact sequence of events from a file.
  
More specific code goals:

- Based on independent components. This components must be able to used without
  the rest of the same level (check components.txt). Also every component will
  show a "C" frontend, not C++ (except for math lib). It will be coded internally
  with C++.
- No need to say, we want a 100% data driven game engine
- Code in DEBUG mode should test a lot; RELEASE not.
- Doxygen is used for documentation
