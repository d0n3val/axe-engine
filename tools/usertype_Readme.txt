usertype.dat
-----------

Copy "usertype.dat" to the visual studio executable directory. From now on, all axe types and functions will be displayed with a differents color. You can change it with the Tools>Options>General>Fonts and Colors

It helps a lot, since yo can see directly if your are typing right directly.
