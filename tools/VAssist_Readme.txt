About VAssist
-------------

Visual Assist is a great Tool provided by "Whole Tomato Software". In order to speed up AXE code typing, here is provided the template file we use.

It's homepage is http://www.WholeTomato.com

Installation
------------

Just copy VAssist.tpl to your "/misc" directory at the Visual Assist installation directory. 

For example, mine is "C:\Program Files\Visual Assist.NET\Misc"

Make sure to make a backup of the original "Vassist.tpl". I dunno if it's possible to mantain different template files to avoid this stuff. Let me know it anyone knows it.
